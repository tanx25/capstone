The patient, a 56-year-old male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, was diagnosed with stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. He began chemotherapy with the following regimen: Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV on day 1 and Etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV on days 1-3, repeated every 21 days for four cycles. In addition, the patient was prescribed Amoxicillin 500 mg orally three times daily for 7 days to treat a concurrent respiratory infection. During the treatment, the patient experienced significant nausea and vomiting, which were managed with Ondansetron 8 mg orally twice daily as needed. Due to the patient's compromised renal function, the Cisplatin dose was reduced by 25% for the last two cycles of chemotherapy. Following the completion of chemotherapy, the patient was started on maintenance therapy with Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks. Additionally, the patient takes Metformin 500 mg orally twice daily for diabetes management and Lisinopril 20 mg orally once daily for hypertension control.
